## Taking Responsibility - The Cat Ate My Source Code

### The idea
Professional engineers own outcomes, not excuses.
When something fails, the job is to explain what went wrong and propose clear options to move forward.

### Real-world scenario
A data migration fails because backups were not verified.
Blaming tools or timelines does not help.
Owning the mistake and offering recovery options does.

### Where this shows up in real systems
- data migrations
- batch jobs
- CI/CD pipelines
- backend services
