# Your Knowledge Portfolio

## Invest in Your Skills

Think of your technical skills like a financial investment portfolio. Your knowledge loses value over time as new technologies appear. To stay valuable, you must invest regularly in learning new things and diversify what you know.

## The idea

You know how people invest money in different stocks and bonds to protect their savings? Good engineers do the same with their knowledge. They don't just learn one programming language and stop. They keep learning new things regularly, even if they don't need them right away. This way, when their company needs to use new technology, they're already prepared instead of panicking.

Think of it like this: if you only know how to use a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. But if you know about screwdrivers, wrenches, and drills too, you can choose the right tool for each job. That's what diversifying your knowledge does—it gives you more tools to solve problems.

## Real-world scenario

Imagine you've been working as a backend engineer for three years. You're really good at Java and you maintain a large application. You're the expert! But then your company's new CTO announces they're moving to a new system using Go and Kubernetes. You've never learned these because "Java works fine."

If you're like the immature engineer, you panic. You resist the change, saying "Why fix what isn't broken?" You hold onto your old knowledge until it becomes less valuable. But if you're like the pragmatic engineer, you've already been learning new things on the side. You're ready because you've been investing in your knowledge portfolio all along.

## Where you'll see this in real projects

- When companies migrate from old systems to new cloud-based ones
- Choosing the right database for a project (SQL vs NoSQL vs in-memory)
- Deciding which programming language to use for different tasks
- Learning new tools that can automate manual work and save time
- When you need to understand both the old system and the new one during a migration
