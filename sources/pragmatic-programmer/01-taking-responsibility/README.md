# Taking Responsibility

## The Cat Ate My Source Code

When things break, don't make excuses. Take responsibility, explain what happened, and help fix it.

## The idea

You know how in group projects, some people always blame others when things go wrong? "It's not my fault, the teacher didn't explain it right!" or "My partner didn't do their part!" Good engineers don't do that. When something breaks, they say: "Okay, here's what went wrong, and here's how we can fix it." No excuses. Just honesty and solutions. This makes people trust you, and problems get solved way faster.

## Real-world scenario

Imagine you're copying all your photos from your old phone to your new phone. Before you start, you should make sure you have a backup (like saving them to Google Photos first). If you skip this step and lose all your photos, you can't just say "the phone broke" or "I didn't have time to backup." A good engineer would say: "I should have backed up first. Let me check if we can recover the photos from the cloud or if there's another way to get them back." See the difference? One person makes excuses, the other person fixes the problem.

## Where you'll see this in real projects

- Copying files from one computer to another (like moving your music library)
- Setting up automatic tasks (like your phone backing up photos every night)
- When websites automatically test new features before showing them to users
- The hidden code that makes websites and apps work (like the engine in a car)
